== Workload example 1: PaaS N-tier architecture

The toolkit’s first example workload deployment creates the resources to
host an N-tier application using managed platform services. This
provisions an Azure SQL Database securely connected to the workload
virtual network using a
https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview[Virtual
Network service endpoint] for the data tier. The web and business tiers
are provisioned using an
https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/environment/intro[Azure App
Service Environment] securely connected to the workload virtual network.

=== Prerequisite: create and configure your parameters file

As discussed in the
link:03-parameters-files.md#parameters-files[parameter files] topic, the
VDC Automation Toolkit provides a default test version of the top-level
deployment parameter file. You will need to create a new version of this
file before running your deployment.

To do this, navigate to the toolkit’s
link:../archetypes/paas[archetypes/paas] folder, then make a copy of the
_archetype.test.json_, and name this copy _archetype.json_. Then proceed
to edit archetype.json providing the subscription, organization,
networking, and other configuration information that you want to use for
your deployment. Make sure you use values for the shared services and
on-premises parameters consistent with those components of your VDC
deployment.

If your copy of the toolkit is associated with a git repository, the
link:../.gitignore[.gitignore] file provided by the default VDC
Automation Toolkit is set to prevent this archetype.json file from being
pushed to your code repository.

=== Deploy workload infrastructure

All workload environments require a common set of operations, key vault,
and virtual network resources before they can connect to the shared
services network and host workloads. The following steps will deploy
these required resources.

==== Step 1: Deploy workload operations and monitoring resources

*Required role: SysOps*

This step provisions the operations and monitoring resources for the
workload environment.

Start the ``la'' deployment by running the following command in the
terminal or command-line interface:

{empty}[Linux/OSX]

____
_python3 vdc.py create workload -path ``archetypes/paas/archetype.json''
-m ``la''_
____

{empty}[Windows]

____
_py vdc.py create workload -path ``archetypes/paas/archetype.json'' -m
``la''_
____

{empty}[Docker]

____
_python vdc.py create workload -path ``archetypes/paas/archetype.json''
-m ``la''_
____

This deployment creates the _\{organization name}-\{deployment
name}-la-rg_ resource group that hosts the resources in the following
table.

[width="100%",cols="42%,14%,44%",options="header",]
|===
|*Resource* |*Type* |*Description*
|\{organization name}-\{deployment name}-oms |Log Analytics |Log
Analytics instance for monitoring the shared services network.
|===

==== Step 2: Deploy workload Key Vault

*Required role: SecOps*

This step deploys the workload ``kv'' resource, which deploys a Key
Vault for the workload environment and generates the encryption keys
that are used for resources deployed by the workspace DevOps teams.

Start the ``kv'' deployment by running the following command in the
terminal or command-line interface:

{empty}[Linux/OSX]

____
_python3 vdc.py create workload -path ``archetypes/paas/archetype.json''
-m ``workload-kv''_
____

{empty}[Windows]

____
_py vdc.py create workload -path ``archetypes/paas/archetype.json'' -m
``workload-kv''_
____

{empty}[Docker]

____
_python vdc.py create workload -path ``archetypes/paas/archetype.json''
-m ``workload-kv''_
____

This deployment creates the _\{organization name}-\{deployment
name}-kv-rg_ resource group that hosts the resources listed in the
following table.

[width="100%",cols="40%,11%,49%",options="header",]
|===
|*Resource* |*Type* |*Description*
|\{organization name}-\{deployment name}-kv |Key Vault |Key Vault
instance for the workload. One certificate deployed by default.

|\{organization name}\{deployment name (dashes removed)}\{random
characters} |Storage account |Location of Key Vault audit logs.
|===

==== Step 3: Deploy workload virtual network

*Required role: NetOps*

This step involves two resource deployments in the following order:

* The ``nsg'' deployment module creates the network security groups
(NSGs) and Azure security groups (ASGs) that secure the workload virtual
network. By default, the example workload net deployment creates a set
of NSGs and ASGs compatible with an _n_-tier application, consisting of
web, business, and data tiers.
* The ``net'' deployment module creates the workload virtual network,
along with setting up the default subnet and User Defined Routes (UDRs)
used to route traffic to the shared services network. This deployment
also creates the VNet peering that connects the shared services and
workload networks.

Start the ``nsg'' deployment by running the following command in the
terminal or command-line interface:

{empty}[Linux/OSX]

____
_python3 vdc.py create workload -path ``archetypes/paas/archetype.json''
-m ``nsg''_
____

{empty}[Windows]

____
_py vdc.py create workload -path ``archetypes/paas/archetype.json'' -m
``nsg''_
____

{empty}[Docker]

____
_python vdc.py create workload -path ``archetypes/paas/archetype.json''
-m ``nsg''_
____

Then start the ``net'' deployment by running the following command in
the terminal or command-line interface:

{empty}[Linux/OSX]

____
_python3 vdc.py create workload -path ``archetypes/paas/archetype.json''
-m ``workload-net''_
____

{empty}[Windows]

____
_py vdc.py create workload -path ``archetypes/paas/archetype.json'' -m
``workload-net''_
____

{empty}[Docker]

____
_python vdc.py create workload -path ``archetypes/paas/archetype.json''
-m ``workloadnet''_
____

These deployments create the _\{organization name}-\{deployment
name}-net-rg_ resource group that hosts the resources detailed in the
following table.

[width="100%",cols="41%,15%,44%",options="header",]
|===
|*Resource* |*Type* |*Description*
|\{organization name}-\{deployment name}-vnet |Virtual network |The
primary workload virtual network, with a single default subnet.

|\{organization name}-\{deployment name}-\{default subnet name}-nsg
|Network security group |Network security group attached to the default
subnet.

|\{organization name}-\{deployment name}-\{default subnet name}-udr
|Route table |User Defined Routes for routing traffic to and from the
shared services network.

|\{deployment name (dashes removed)} |Storage account |Storage location
for virtual network diagnostic data.
|===

=== Deploy workload resources

Once the workload operations, Key Vault, and virtual network resources
are provisioned, your team can begin deploying actual workload
resources. Performing the following tasks provisions the Azure SQL
Database and App Service Environment needed for DevOps to deploy an
application with a data, business, and web tier.

==== Deploy Azure SQL Database

The ``sqldb'' deployment module creates the Azure SQL Database and
secure service endpoint used for the application’s data tier. Start this
deployment by running the following command in the terminal or
command-line interface:

{empty}[Linux/OSX]

____
_python3 vdc.py create workload -path ``archetypes/paas/archetype.json''
-m ``__sqldb__''_
____

{empty}[Windows]

____
_py vdc.py create workload -path ``archetypes/paas/archetype.json'' -m
``__sqldb__''_
____

{empty}[Docker]

____
_python vdc.py create workload -path ``archetypes/paas/archetype.json''
-m ``__sqldb__''_
____

This deployment creates the _\{organization name}-\{deployment
name}-sqldb-rg_ resource group that hosts the resources shown in the
following table.

[width="100%",cols="42%,11%,47%",options="header",]
|===
|*Resource* |*Type* |*Description*
|\{organization name}-\{deployment name}-db-server01 |SQL server |Azure
SQL Database server hosting the data-tier database.

|sqldb01 |SQL database |Azure SQL Database.
|===

==== Deploy App Service Environment for business and web tiers

The ``ase'' deployment module creates a new App Service Environment
within the workload virtual network and creates three instances of a
single app service that provides the application’s web tier. Start this
deployment by running the following command in the terminal or
command-line interface:

{empty}[Linux/OSX]

____
_python3 vdc.py create workload -path ``archetypes/paas/archetype.json''
-m ``__ase__''_
____

{empty}[Windows]

____
_py vdc.py create workload -path ``archetypes/paas/archetype.json'' -m
``__ase__''_
____

{empty}[Docker]

____
_python vdc.py create workload -path ``archetypes/paas/archetype.json''
-m ``__ase__''_
____

This deployment creates the _\{organization name}-\{deployment
name}-ase-rg_ resource group that hosts the following resources:

[width="100%",cols="33%,16%,51%",options="header",]
|===
|*Resource* |*Type* |*Description*
|samplemvc |App Service |Example App service instance deployed to the
App Service plan.

|\{organization name}-\{deployment name}-app-plan |App Service plan
|Default App Server plan for hosting DevOps App Services.

|\{organization name}-\{deployment name}-ase |App Service Environment
|App Service Environment deployed securely inside the workload virtual
network.
|===

Once the App Service Environment is created, DevOps teams can create
https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/environment/create-ilb-ase#create-an-app-in-an-ilb-ase[additional
web and business tier app services].
