# Setting up the toolkit

We recommend using the Docker image to run the toolkit.
However, you can run the toolkit locally if you choose.
After getting the toolkit setup, you'll be ready to make your first deployment with the toolkit.

1. [Run the Docker image](setup-docker.md)
1. [Run on your local machine](setup-local.md)
1. [Your first deploment](your-first-deployment.md)
