= Deploying the simulated on-premises environment

All of the sample archetypes provided in the Azure Virtual Datacenter Automation Toolkit, inclduing the shared services archetype, are configured to work with a _simulated on-premises environment_.

This environment provides a virtual network with a VPN gateway and a single VM. This VM is configured as the **Contoso** primary domain controller and provides domain services to all other resources once the shared services network is connected to this simulated on-premises environment.

In the default configuration provided by the toolkit, any resources deployed with the sample archetypes will be be isolated from the internet except for the simulated on-premises. The only way to access these isolated resources will be through the domain controller VM after the shared services network is connected.

This is intended to simulate the experience of a _trusted datacenter extension_, where none of the public cloud resources can communicate directly with the internet and all traffic is routed through the on-premises environment.

If you're planning to use a simulated on-premises, you should deploy it before starting the sample shared services deployment.

== Prerequisite: create and configure your parameters file

The toolkit provides an example configuration file for the simulated on-premises environment. You will need to create a new version of this file before running your deployment.

1. Navigate to the toolkit's link:../../archetypes/on-premises[archetypes/on-premises] folder.
1. Make a copy of the `archetype.test.json` and name the copy `archetype.json`.
1. Edit `archetype.json` providing the subscription, organization, networking, and other configuration information that you want to use for your deployment. You will need to use some of the same values when creating the configuration for the shared services environment.

If your copy of the toolkit is associated with the git repository, the link:../../.gitignore[.gitignore] file is set to prevent your deployment `archetype.json` file from being pushed to your code repository.

NOTE: The `deployment-user-id` is the user's Azure Active Directory object id.

== Run the deployment

Deploy the `on-premises` archetype by running the following command in the terminal
or command-line interface:

.Docker
[source,bash]
python vdc.py create on-premises -path archetypes/on-premises/archetype.json --upload-scripts

.Linux/OSX
[source,bash]
python3 vdc.py create on-premises -path archetypes/on-premises/archetype.json --upload-scripts

.Windows
[source,cmd]
py vdc.py create on-premises -path archetypes/on-premises/archetype.json --upload-scripts

== What's deployed

This deployment creates two resource groups. The resource groups are name using value your provided in the configuration.

- `{organization name}-{deployment name}-onprem-net-rg` 
- `{organization name}-{deployment name}-onprem-ad-rg` 

Let's assume `org` and `example` for `{organization name}` and `{deployment name}`.

=== `org-example-onprem-net-rg`

This resource group contains the networking resources for the simulated on-premises environment.

[options="header",cols="a,,"]

| Resource | Type | Description

| `org-example-default-nsg`
| Network security group

| `org-example-vnet`
| Virtual network

=== `org-example-onprem-ad-rg`

This reosurce group contains the Active Directory servers and related resources used in the simulated on-premises environment.
